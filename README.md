# A-B-Testing-using-Python
A/B Testing means analyzing two marketing strategies to choose the best marketing strategy that can convert more traffic into sales (or more traffic into your desired goal) effectively and efficiently. 

###  Project Overview
In A/B testing, we analyze the results of two marketing strategies to choose the best one for future marketing campaigns. For example, when I started an ad campaign on Instagram to promote my Instagram post for the very first time, my target audience was different from the target audience of my second ad campaign. After analyzing the results of both ad campaigns, I always preferred the audience of the second ad campaign as it gave better reach and followers than the first one.

That is what A/B testing means. Your goal can be to boost sales, followers, or traffic, but when we choose the best marketing strategy according to the results of our previous marketing campaigns, it is nothing but A/B testing.

For the task of A/B testing using Python, we need to have a dataset about two different marketing strategies for the same goal. I found a dataset that will help us perform A/B testing.

### Tools
- Python - Data Cleaning & Report Creation

### Data Cleaing/Preapration
In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks:

Data loading and inspection.
Handling missing values.
Data cleaning and formatting.
  
### Research Questions:
Is there a significant difference in the number of purchases between the control and test campaigns?
Does the test campaign result in more website clicks compared to the control campaign?
Which campaign is more cost-efficient in driving purchases, based on the amount spent?
Which campaign delivers a better Return on Ad Spend (ROAS), defined as the revenue generated (or proxy as purchases) divided by the amount spent?
Does the test campaign improve customer journey metrics such as moving from Content Viewed to Added to Cart and then to Purchases?

### Conclusion
From the above A/B tests, we found that the control campaign resulted in more sales and engagement from the visitors. More products were viewed from the control campaign, resulting in more products in the cart and more sales. But the conversation rate of products in the cart is higher in the test campaign. The test campaign resulted in more sales according to the products viewed and added to the cart. And the control campaign results in more sales overall. So, the Test campaign can be used to market a specific product to a specific audience, and the Control campaign can be used to market multiple products to a wider audience.
